# Employee Salary Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of employee salary data using both a Jupyter notebook and a Tableau workbook. The analyses provide insights into various aspects of employee salaries, including the influence of position, gender, and experience on salary distribution.

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loading the employee dataset and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Data Exploration**: General statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of salaries, experience, and other employee attributes.
3. **Detailed Analysis**: 
    - Exploration of salaries based on position, gender, and experience.
    - Visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts.
4. **Experience and Salary Analysis**: Analysis showing that employees with more experience tend to have higher mean salaries.
5. **Conclusions**: Insights drawn from the analysis, such as higher salaries for IT managers and DevOps engineers, and the relatively lower cost of web developers.

### Tableau Workbook

The Tableau workbook (`tableau-empData-salary.twb`) includes the following sheets:

1. **Sal by ID**: Salary by employee ID.
2. **avg sal by gender**: Average salary by gender.
3. **avg sal by position**: Average salary by position.
4. **avg salary**: General analysis of average salary.
5. **emp count by gender**: Employee count by gender.
6. **emp count in position**: Employee count in different positions.
7. **max sal**: Maximum salary.
8. **min sal**: Minimum salary.

## Usage

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
    - Open the `employees_data.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
    - Run the cells sequentially to load the data, perform the analysis, and view the visualizations.

2. **Tableau Workbook**:
    - Open the `tableau-empData-salary.twb` file using Tableau Desktop.
    - Explore the different sheets to gain insights into the employee salary data.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into how various factors such as position, gender, and experience affect employee salaries. For further decision-making, additional data such as revenues by position would be helpful.
